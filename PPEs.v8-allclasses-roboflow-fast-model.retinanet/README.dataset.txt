# Personal Protective Equipment Dataset and Model

This dataset is a collection of images that contains annotations for the classes below:

*  goggles
*  helmet
*  mask
*  no-suit
*  no_goggles
*  no_helmet
*  no_mask
*  no_shoes
*  shoes
*  suit
*  no_glove
*  glove


## Usage

Most of these classes are underrepresented and would need to be [balanced](https://blog.roboflow.com/handling-unbalanced-classes/) for better detection. An improved model can be utilized for use cases that'll detect the classes above in order to minimize exposure to hazards that cause serious workplace injuries.
